  Some say music is what colors sound like. Our goal is to bridge the auditory and visual senses using XR development and techniques.
  We wish to enhance existing audio visualizer apps by having Virtual Reality in mind. 
  We will make use of space and depth in conjunction with beat detection and spectrum analysis data for all kinds of creative possibilities for colors, lights, and shapes around you.

  <h4>State-of-art and new challenges</h4>
  Implementing the audio visualization as it syncs with the music. <br>
  Physics of visualizations as it interacts with other objects in the environment <br>
  Creating an immersive environment where you feel like you are in space with visualizers being everywhere where you look <br>

  <h4>Proposed Tasks</h4>
  Short-term: Create a room with audio that syncs up with basic visual representation of the audio components. <br>
  Long-term: Add visual customization in the form of colors, shapes, and audio unmixing. Add more features for quality of life of the application (changing volume, pitch, etc. )


  <h4>Possible ideas that we plan to pursue</h4>
  Audio unmixing
  Sound propagation
  User choice to change type of environments that affects the audio visualization
  Visualizations forming around the room and possibly bouncing around with physics
  User can hear different intensities of the audio spectrum depending on where they stand in the room
  Can change the materials of the room walls to affect sound propagation (open ceiling, concert hall, outdoor concert, etc. ). 

  <h4>Minimum expected accomplishments by April 25th</h4>
  Have basic visualizations appear in the environment that syncs with the music <br>
  Have our “concert” room made with audio able to be played <br>
  Button to start and stop audio <br>

  <h4>Minimum expected accomplishments by mid-May</h4>
  Have a completely immersiveness concert-space-like environment where visuals of varying colors are being formed, flying about, and eventually fading out.

  <h4>What has been done so far : </h4>
- Created dome in blender <br>
- Created simple audio visualizer <br>
- Successfully unmixed multiple songs into four streams (drums/bass/vocals/other) <br>
- Created objects to represent these in our audio visualizer <br>
  <br>
  
  <h4>Currently working on : </h4>
- code for having objects represent and react to a certain part of a song <br>
- letting certain parts of a song be louder when you stand closer to them <br>
- adding sound synthesis to the materials of the dome and possibly add different environments <br>
- more visually pleasing features  <br>
  
  <h4> Other goals: </h4>
- Add buttons to mute certain parts of a song so that you can listen to specific parts (ex: ONLY drums or ONLY vocals)
